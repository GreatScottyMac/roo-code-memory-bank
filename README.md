## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Configure Custom Instructions

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/main/.clinerules-code
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/main/.clinerules-architect
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/main/.clinerules-ask
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/main/.clinerules-debug
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/main/.clinerules-test
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/main/.roomodes
```

Run this script in your terminal to download the necessary files.

#### a. Copy Rule and Mode Files

Download and copy these files to your project's **root** directory:

| Mode | Rule File | Purpose |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Code | [`.clinerules-code`](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/blob/main/.clinerules-code) | Implementation and coding tasks |
| Architect | [`.clinerules-architect`](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/blob/main/.clinerules-architect) | System design and architecture |
| Ask | [`.clinerules-ask`](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/blob/main/.clinerules-ask) | Information and assistance |
| Debug | [`.clinerules-debug`](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/blob/main/.clinerules-debug) | Troubleshooting and problem-solving |
| Test | [`.clinerules-test`](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/blob/main/.clinerules-test) | Test-driven development and quality assurance |
| Mode | [`.roomodes`](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/blob/main/.roomodes) | Custom mode configuration file for Test mode |

> 📝 **Special Note for Test Mode**: Test mode requires both the [`.clinerules-test`](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/blob/main/.clinerules-test) file AND [`.roomodes`](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/blob/main/.roomodes) file in your project root for proper functionality.

#### b. Configure Roo Code Prompt Settings

> ⚠️ **Important**: The system default descriptions in the Role Definition boxes can remain but leave the Mode-specific Custom Instructions boxes empty.

### 2. Initialize Memory Bank

1. Switch to **Architect** or **Code** mode in Roo Code chat
2. Send a message (e.g., "hello")
3. Roo will automatically:
   - 🔍 Scan for `memory-bank/` directory
   - 📁 Create it if missing (with your approval)
   - 📝 Initialize core files
   - 🚦 Provide next steps

<details>
<summary>💡 Pro Tip: Project Brief</summary>

Create a `projectBrief.md` in your project root **before** initialization to give Roo immediate project context.
