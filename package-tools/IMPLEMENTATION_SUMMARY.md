# Cline Rules Package Implementation Summary

This document provides an overview of the implementation of the Cline Rules packages for both NPM and NuGet ecosystems.

## Overview

We've created a complete implementation for distributing Cline configuration files as packages for both NPM (JavaScript/Node.js) and NuGet (.NET) ecosystems. These packages automatically extract configuration files to the root of consuming projects during installation or build.

## Implementation Details

### NPM Package

The NPM package uses a postinstall script to extract configuration files to the root of the consuming project during installation. Key features include:

- **Automatic extraction** during `npm install`
- **Manual extraction** via `npx cline-rules-extract`
- **Programmatic API** for custom extraction
- **Preservation of existing files** to avoid overwriting local modifications

### NuGet Package

The NuGet package uses MSBuild targets to extract configuration files to the root of the consuming project during build. Key features include:

- **Automatic extraction** during project build
- **Integration with MSBuild pipeline**
- **Preservation of existing files** to avoid overwriting local modifications

## Testing

Both packages include test scripts to verify the extraction functionality:

- **NPM Package**: `npm test` runs a script that extracts files to a test directory
- **NuGet Package**: PowerShell and Bash scripts that create a test project and install the package

## Usage

### NPM Package

```bash
# Install the package
npm install cline-rules

# Manual extraction
npx cline-rules-extract

# Programmatic use
const clinerRules = require('cline-rules');
clinerRules.extractConfigFiles();
```

### NuGet Package

```bash
# Install the package
dotnet add package ClinerRules

# The files will be extracted during build
dotnet build
```

## Versioning

Both packages follow semantic versioning:

- **Patch version** (1.0.x): For minor changes or corrections
- **Minor version** (1.x.0): For new features or non-breaking changes
- **Major version** (x.0.0): For breaking changes

## Publishing

### Manual Publishing

#### NPM Package

```bash
cd package-tools/npm-package
npm publish
```

#### NuGet Package

```bash
cd package-tools/nuget-package
dotnet pack -c Release
dotnet nuget push bin/Release/ClinerRules.1.0.0.nupkg -k YOUR_API_KEY -s https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json
```

### Automated Publishing with GitHub Actions

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the building, testing, and publishing of both packages. The workflow is defined in the root of the repository at `.github/workflows/build-packages.yml` and provides the following features:

- **Continuous Integration**: Builds and tests both packages on multiple operating systems and runtime versions
- **Artifact Generation**: Creates package artifacts for each build configuration
- **Automated Publishing**: Publishes packages to NPM and NuGet when a GitHub release is created
- **Documentation Updates**: Automatically updates version references in documentation files

The workflow runs automatically on:
- Push to any branch (development builds)
- Pull requests to the main branch
- Creation of a new release

To use the GitHub Actions workflow for publishing:

1. Set up the required secrets in your GitHub repository:
   - `NPM_TOKEN`: Your NPM authentication token
   - `NUGET_API_KEY`: Your NuGet API key

2. Create a new release in GitHub with the appropriate version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)

3. The workflow will automatically build, test, and publish both packages to their respective registries

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust solution for distributing Cline configuration files to projects in both JavaScript/Node.js and .NET ecosystems. The packages are designed to be easy to use, maintain, and update, with a focus on preserving local modifications and providing clear documentation. The included GitHub Actions workflow further streamlines the development and release process, ensuring consistent builds and automated publishing.
